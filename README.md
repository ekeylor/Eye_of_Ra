<h1>Eye of Ra</h1>
<p>Eye of Ra is a 3D Unity prototype (more like a test harness) for a game idea to teach Egyptian hieroglyphs.  (Yes, flash cards would be easier).  The idea is that you are on Ra's solar boat--Ra is the Egyptian sun god--and are traversing the underworld at night to re-emerge to create the next, new day.  You use the Eye of Ra to select glyphs to unlock passages and escape the underworld.</p>
<p>An English letter will appear in front of the player.  The player uses the mouse to direct the Eye or Ra to select the correct glyph.  When the ray becomes solid, the glyph will be selected.</p>
<p>This is a basic harness to test the main interaction (game mechanic) idea.  Feedback is only given in the console.  I'd like to use this to further explore systems in Unity 2017 and see to what degree the experience can be translated to mobile devices.  (That's the purpose of using the ray for selection.  This can translate to Google Cardboard.)  Since this takes place in the underworld, there are lots of opportunities for effects and weird monsters.</p>
